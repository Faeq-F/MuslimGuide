  <ul>

    <li>

      Pray Fajr in Mina and go to Arafat any time after sunrise.

    </li>

    <li>

      Stop over if possible at Namirah (place close to ‘Arafah - is now a Masjid
      there) and remain until after Zawaal (sun at highest point - no shadow)
      and listen to the Khutbah.

      <br /><br />

      If this is not possible, it is permissible to proceed to ‘Arafah,
      remaining there until sunset. Make dua anywhere in the grounds of Arafah.

    </li>

    <li>

      Facing the Qiblah, with raised hands, supplicate. It is encouraged to
      frequently recite the following:

      <br /><br />

      --

      <br />

      La ilaha ill Allahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu lahul mulk wa lahul hamdu wa
      huwa 'alaa kulli shay ‘in qadeer

      <br />

      There is none truly worthy of worship except Allah alone, without partner.
      To Him belongs all Sovereignty and all Praise, and He is Omnipotent over
      all things.

    </li>

    <li>

      Pray Dhuhr & Asr at Arafah (shortened & combined with one Azaan).

      <br /><br />

      According to Hanafi opinion, Dhuhr and Asr can only be combined in Masjid
      al-Namirah behind the Imam & not in tents.

      <br />

      The other three Sunni schools of thought state that it is permissible to
      combine the prayers in the tents.

    </li>

    <li>

      Perform WUQUF (stay on grounds of Arafat), make dua (supplications) and
      seek forgiveness until sunset.

    </li>

    <li>

      After sunset go to Muzdalifah.

    </li>

  </ul>
