        When does Hajj take place?
      </div>
      It takes place during the same time each year, in the sacred month of Dhul
      Hijjah - the twelfth month in the Islamic Calendar.
      <br /><br />
      Hajj begins on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and lasts approximately five to six
      days depending on the sighting of the moon.
      <br /><br />
      When the new crescent moon is sighted, Muslims around the world welcome in
      the four-day festival of Eid al-Adha.

        The requirement of Hajj
      </div>
      While Hajj is required of every Muslim, it is only required so long as
      they have the capacity.
      <br /><br />
      There are conditions which make Muslims eligible to perform Hajj and
      exempt from performing Hajj.

        The opportunity of Hajj
      </div>
      Hajj offers a chance to wipe clean past sins and start anew before Allah.
      <br /><br />
      Additionally, the act of performing Hajj with increased Taqwa (being
      God-conscious) and to a high standard of perfection, is rewarded with
      Paradise.
