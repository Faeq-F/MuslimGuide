        Prepare yourself for Hajj
      </div>
      While Hajj is first and foremost a spiritual
      duty, it is also very physically demanding and preparing for Hajj is
      greatly encouraged for Muslims around the world.

      As pilgrims walk on average between 5km-15km per day, it is encouraged for
      Muslims to physically prepare for Hajj weeks in advance, so that the
      travel that is required between locations across the five-six-day
      pilgrimage is not a shock to the system.
      <br /><br />
      Being physically prepared provides an aide to the emotionally and
      spiritually demanding aspects of Hajj.
