  A pilgrim makes an intention to come into the state of Ihram (sacredness /
  prohibition) before passing the five meeqat (a stated place) points.

  <br /><br />

  Certain restrictions are placed on a pilgrim as they will be performing Umrah.
  If you are travelling by air, you will make the intention 45 mins before
  landing & if by road then the intention needs to be made before passing any
  meeqat point.

  <br /><br />

  A male pilgrim wears two clean ihram garments - one wrapped around his waist
  and the other over his shoulders.

  <br />

  Slippers can be used (by men). No tailored clothes (clothing cut to fit the
  limbs of your body) should be worn by men.

  <br /><br />

  There is no particular dress or colour of dress for a woman in Ihram, other
  than the usually specified in the sunnah. She should not wear face mask
  (niqab) or gloves. She can cover her face before strange men using a part of
  her head cover / extended cloth.


  <br /><br />


  Throughout these holy days and whilst in the state of Ihram, we should also be
  particularly mindful of our behaviour and words.

  <ul>

    <li>

      We should avoid smoking, engaging in sexual relations, swearing, shaving
      our hair, and cutting our nails.

    </li>

    <li>

      We must also NOT use perfume or scented soaps.

    </li>

  </ul>


  <br /><br />


  Start Umrah:<br />

  To enter state of Ihram, you should have worn the clothes of Ihram.

  <br /><br />

  Now say the following:

  <br />

  --

  <br />

  Labbayka llahumma 'umratan

  <br />

  O Allah, here I am to perform Umrah

  <br /><br />

  Say the Talbiyah, the prayer is as follows:

  <br />

  --

  <br />

  Labbayka llahumma labbayk(a), labbayka la sharika laka labbayk(a), inna
  l-hamda wa n-ni'mata, laka wa l-mulk(a), la sharÄ«ka lak

  <br />

  At Your service, Allah, at Your service. At Your service, You have no partner,
  at Your service. Truly all praise, favour and sovereignty are Yours. You have
  no partner.
