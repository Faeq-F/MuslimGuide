  After completing the Saey, the pilgrim must shave / trim his hair to come out
  of the state of ihram.

  <br />

  Men should get their heads completely shaved or get their hair trimmed evenly.

  <br />

  Women, however should only clip their hair evenly from the bottom to the
  length of a fingertip. They are forbidden to shave their heads.

  <br /><br />

  Congratulations!<br />

  Your Umrah is Complete!
