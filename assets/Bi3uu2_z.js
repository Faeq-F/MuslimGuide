      Tawaf is one of the principal rites of the pilgrimage.

      <br>

      It means circling around something with devotion.

      <br><br>

      During Umrah, it means moving around the ka&#39;abah 7 times.

      <br>

      One Tawaf is made up of seven complete circuits, with each one starting
      and ending at Hajar Aswad (black stone), which is situated within the
      Kaa&#39;bah.

      <br><br>

      Prophet SAW said:

      <br>

      &#39;The Black Stone is from Paradise&#39; (Nisai 2935)

      <br>

      If you can touch it without causing harm then its fine, otherwise avoid.

      <br><br>

      Go around the &#39;U&#39; shape structure. It is called &#39;Hateem&#39; &amp; it is part of
      the Ka&#39;bah. Praying in it means, you have prayed in the Ka&#39;bah.

      <br><br>

      In Tawaf:<br>

      Each round of Tawaf is started by raising the right hand facing the black
      stone (kiss it if possible) &amp; proclaiming &#39;Bimillahi Allah hu Akbar&#39;.

      <br><br>

      First 3 rounds are completed by walking fast (men only &amp; if possible).

      <br><br>

      Then remaining 4 rounds are completed by walking on a normal pace. You can
      make any dua in any language.


      <br><br>

      Start Tawaf:<br>
