      It takes place during the same time each year, in the sacred month of Dhul
      Hijjah - the twelfth month in the Islamic Calendar.
      <br><br>
      Hajj begins on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and lasts approximately five to six
      days depending on the sighting of the moon.

        The requirement of Hajj

      While Hajj is required of every Muslim, it is only required so long as
      they have the capacity.

      There are conditions which make Muslims eligible to perform Hajj and
