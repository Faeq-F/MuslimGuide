      Saey literally means to walk / to strive.

      <br>

      In Umrah it means to walk between the hilltops of Mount Safa &amp; Mount Marwa
      7 times.

      <br>

      Here you act like Hajar, the mother of Ismail.

      <br><br>

      Allah ordered Ibrahim AS to leave Hajar AS &amp; Ismail AS in the barren land
      of Makkah &amp; she remained patient &amp; steadfast.

      <br>

      Our running between the 2 green lights is replicating her hurrying to find
      food for her son Ismail AS.

      <br>

      Allah loved the action &amp; made it part of Umrah.

    </li> <li>

      Start Saey:<br>

      Male pilgrim should cover their shoulder.

      <br>

      Walk towards Mt. Safa, it is sunnah to recite 1st part of the following
      verse &amp; then the supplication:

      <br><br>

      --

      <br>

      Inna s-safa wa l-marwata min sha&#39;a&#39;iri llah(i)

      <br>

      Indeed, Safa and Marwa are from the Signs of Allah. [Surah al-Baqarah,
      2:158]

      <br><br>

      --

      <br>

      Abda&#39;u bima bad&#39;allahu bihi

      <br>

      I begin with that which Allah has begun with

    </li> <li>

      Then recite the following supplication from Sunnah or make any Dua.

      <br>

      You can read this supplication three times and make personal Dua in
      between, and start walking towards Marwa.

      <br><br>

      La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharÄ«ka lah(u), lahu l-mulku wa lahu l-hamdu
      yuhyi wa yumit(u), wa huwa &#39;ala kulli shay&#39;in qadir.

      <br>

      --

      <br>

      La ilaha illallahu wahdah(u), anjaza wa&#39;dahu wa nasara &#39;abdahu wa hazama
      l-ahzaba wahdah.

      <br>

      Allah is the greatest; Allah is the greatest; Allah is the greatest. There
      is no deity except Allah, alone without a partner. To Him belongs the
      Dominion, and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and death and He
      has power over everything. There is no deity except Allah alone. He
      fulfilled His promise, supported His slave and defeated the confederates
      alone.

      <br><br>

      After the supplication, proceed towards Marwa while making any Dua.

      <br>

      A pilgrim will complete one circuit after reaching &#39;Marwa&#39; and repeat
      point 2.

      <br><br>

      Note: If possible men should run between the 2 green pillars (lights) if
      they are able to and women walk at their normal pace

      Upon reaching mount Marwa for the last time, you have completed the Saey.
