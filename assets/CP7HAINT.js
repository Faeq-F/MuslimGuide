      Pray Fajr in Mina and go to Arafat any time after sunrise.

      Stop over if possible at Namirah (place close to ‘Arafah - is now a Masjid
      there) and remain until after Zawaal (sun at highest point - no shadow)
      and listen to the Khutbah.

      <br><br>

      If this is not possible, it is permissible to proceed to ‘Arafah,
      remaining there until sunset. Make dua anywhere in the grounds of Arafah.

      Facing the Qiblah, with raised hands, supplicate. It is encouraged to
      frequently recite the following:

      <br><br>

      --

      <br>

      La ilaha ill Allahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu lahul mulk wa lahul hamdu wa
      huwa &#39;alaa kulli shay ‘in qadeer

      <br>

      There is none truly worthy of worship except Allah alone, without partner.
      To Him belongs all Sovereignty and all Praise, and He is Omnipotent over
      all things.

    </li> <li>

      Pray Dhuhr &amp; Asr at Arafah (shortened &amp; combined with one Azaan).

      <br><br>

      According to Hanafi opinion, Dhuhr and Asr can only be combined in Masjid
      al-Namirah behind the Imam &amp; not in tents.

      <br>

      The other three Sunni schools of thought state that it is permissible to
      combine the prayers in the tents.

    </li> <li>

      Perform WUQUF (stay on grounds of Arafat), make dua (supplications) and
      seek forgiveness until sunset.

    </li> <li>

      After sunset go to Muzdalifah.
