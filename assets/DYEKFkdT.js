  On 10th Dhul Hijjah, it is recommended you follow the following sequence:

  <ol><li>

      Rami (Stoning)

    </li> <li>

      Hady (Sacrifice an animal)

    </li> <li>

      Halq (cut hair)

    </li> <li>

      Tawaf Az-ziyarah

    </li></ol>

  If for some reason, you can not follow the sequence then it will be fine.

  <br><br>

  Pilgrims following hanafi opinion have to follow the sequence, otherwise they
  may have to sacrifice an additional animal as penalty.

  <br><br> <ul><li>

      Pray Fajr in Muzdalifah, make dua until slightly few minutes before
      sunrise and leave for Mina and continuously recite the Talbiyah.

      <br>

      Calmly proceed to Jamaratul-â€™Aqabah al-Kubraa (The Large Pillar) for
      stoning.

    </li> <li>

      Facing Jamarah (Stoning Pillar), with Makkah to your left and Mina to your
      right, throw seven stones at Jamarah reciting the takbir each time you
      throw the stone:

      <br><br>

      --

      <br>

      Allahu Akbar

      <br>

      Allah is the Greatest

      <br>

      (after each throw)

      <br><br>

      Note: There is no &#39;SHAITAAN&#39; chained here, you should not throw a slipper
      or swear.

      <br>

      A pilgrim throws the stones, glorifies Allah like the Prophet PBUH &amp;
      remembers the test of Ibrahim AS.

    </li> <li>

      Hadi/Sacrifice:<br>

      Your tour operator should give you guidelines in sacrificing the animal.

      <br><br>

      After Hadi, get your hair shaved.
