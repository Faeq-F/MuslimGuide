  Hajj is a sacred pilgrimage that is required of every Muslim at least once in
  their lifetime – it is one of the five pillars of Islam.

  <br><br>

  It takes place during the same time each year, in the sacred month of Dhul
  Hijjah – the twelfth month in the Islamic Calendar.

  <br>

  Hajj begins on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and lasts approximately five to six days
  depending on the sighting of the moon.

  <br>

  When the new crescent moon is sighted, Muslims around the world welcome in the
  four-day festival of Eid al-Adha.

  <br><br>

  While Hajj is required of every Muslim, it is only required so long as they
  have the capacity.

  <br>

  There are conditions which make Muslims eligible to perform Hajj and exempt
  from performing Hajj.

  <br><br>

  Hajj offers a chance to wipe clean past sins and start anew before Allah.

  <br>

  Additionally, the act of performing Hajj with increased Taqwa (being
  God-conscious) and to a high standard of perfection, is rewarded with
  Paradise.
