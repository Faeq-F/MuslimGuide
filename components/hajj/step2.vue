  Prepare yourself for Hajj. While Hajj is first and foremost a spiritual duty,
  it is also very physically demanding and preparing for Hajj is greatly
  encouraged for Muslims around the world.

  <br /><br />

  As pilgrims walk on average between 5km-15km per day, it is encouraged for
  Muslims to physically prepare for Hajj weeks in advance, so that the travel
  that is required between locations across the five-six-day pilgrimage is not a
  shock to the system.

  <br />

  Being physically prepared provides an aide to the emotionally and spiritually
  demanding aspects of Hajj.

  <br />

  Once you have worn the ihram & made the intention, you will come into the
  state of Ihram.
