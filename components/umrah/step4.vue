      Tawaf is one of the principal rites of the pilgrimage.

      <br />

      It means circling around something with devotion.

      <br /><br />

      During Umrah, it means moving around the ka'abah 7 times.

      <br />

      One Tawaf is made up of seven complete circuits, with each one starting
      and ending at Hajar Aswad (black stone), which is situated within the
      Kaa'bah.

      <br /><br />

      Prophet SAW said:

      <br />

      'The Black Stone is from Paradise' (Nisai 2935)

      <br />

      If you can touch it without causing harm then its fine, otherwise avoid.

      <br /><br />

      Go around the 'U' shape structure. It is called 'Hateem' & it is part of
      the Ka'bah. Praying in it means, you have prayed in the Ka'bah.

      <br /><br />

      In Tawaf:<br />

      Each round of Tawaf is started by raising the right hand facing the black
      stone (kiss it if possible) & proclaiming 'Bimillahi Allah hu Akbar'.

      <br /><br />

      First 3 rounds are completed by walking fast (men only & if possible).

      <br /><br />

      Then remaining 4 rounds are completed by walking on a normal pace. You can
      make any dua in any language.


      <br /><br />

      Start Tawaf:<br />

      Men will 'UNCOVER' their right shoulder.

      <br />

      'Raise' your right hand, face the black stone & Recite:

      <br />

      --

      <br />

      Bismi llahi wa llahu akbar

      <br />

      In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest

      <br /><br />

      Make dua & you can make any dua in any language.

      Then between Yamani corner & Black stone - say the following dua:

      <br />

      O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers
      of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor
      will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and
      for me is my religion.

      <br /><br />

      begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.
