  Battle of Uhud took place here.

  <br />

  Narrated Anas bin Malik:<br />

  When the mountain of Uhud came in the sight of Allah's Messenger (صلى الله
  عليه وسلم ) he said. <br />

  "This is a mountain that loves us and is loved by us. O Allah! Abraham made
  Mecca a sanctuary, and I make (the area) in between these two mountains (of
  Medina) a sanctuary." (Bukhari)

  <br /><br />

  Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:

  <br />

  "One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than one thousand prayers offered
  anywhere else except Al-Masjid al Haram."

  <br />

  - Bukhari, Muslim

  Visit the Prophet's Rawdah (grave) to send Salam

  <br />

  As you pass by the graves, there are 3 gold railings.

  <br />

  In the middle railing, it says ‘Huna Rasulallah’ which means here is the
  Prophet’s grave. Then it says, ‘Huna Abu Bakr (RA)’ and then ‘Huna Umar (RA).’

  <br />

  While passing by the Rawda (Grave of the Prophet), you can send Salam in the
  following manner:
